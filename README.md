# dripdrop

This project utilizes a Bitcoin dataset and allows for querying through natural language.

This is my approach for the CFG take home assignment:

I built this similar to how I would build an MVP, small iterations to ensure everything is working as expected, then refactoring to meet coding standards.
This allows me to have confidence in the logic, but also allows me to build on top of existing functionality in the future.
